“Let’s Go into Sleep Mode”: A Campaign to Eliminate In-Bed Screen Use Among Early Adolescents at Hardy Middle School in Washington, D.C.

Problem Definition

When night falls, you finally sink into bed and pick up a screen “just for a minute.” You scroll through social media, reply to a few messages, watch an episode of a show, or queue up one more round of a game. The room is dark, the screen is bright, and time feels like it belongs only to you.

This scene is so familiar... For many people, late-night in-bed screen use has quietly become part of the bedtime routine. Yet this ordinary habit can strongly shape how well we sleep, how we feel, and how we function the next day.

Target Behavior: In-bed screen use

This nighttime in-bed screen use, defined as engaging with phones, tablets, consoles, or TVs while in bed before or at bedtime, or during the sleep period, is the target behavior in this campaign (Nagata et al., 2024).

Emerging evidence indicates that in-bed screen time predicts later sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, and poorer sleep quality, especially with interactive uses such as texting, gaming, and social media (Hale & Guan, 2015; Sanjeev et al., 2020). For example, a 2024 study showed that each additional 10 minutes of in-bed screen time was linked to an approximately 10-minute delay in sleep onset and a measurable loss of total sleep duration that night (Brosnan et al., 2024). Beyond direct time displacement, in-bed screen use can disrupt the sleep–wake cycle through psychophysiological arousal from engaging with content and anticipating social responses, screen light suppressing melatonin production, and nocturnal notifications that fragment sleep (Chang et al., 2015; Nagata et al., 2023; Scott & Woods, 2018).

Scope of the Problem and Affected Population

This campaign specifically targets U.S. early adolescents, as they are among the populations most affected by using screens in bed. This focus is based on research showing their high rates of digital device ownership and significant use of screens during typical sleeping hours.

In detail, by 2021, about half of children and early adolescents in the U.S. reported having their own digital devices, and by 2023, mobile phone ownership among 13–14-year-olds had reached 92% (Common Sense Media, 2022; Pew Research Center & MarketingCharts, 2024). A 2019 study reported that over half of teens brought their devices into bed, 29% actually slept with them, and 36% were awakened by notifications during the night—figures that have likely increased along with device ownership (Robb, 2019).

Why This Behavior Is Problematic

Screen use in bed is problematic because it significantly disrupts sleep, while poor sleep, in turn, can lead to a range of other health and everyday life issues.

Numerous studies of early adolescents have shown that screen use around bedtime is associated with reduced sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and greater difficulty falling asleep (Fuller et al., 2017; Hysing et al., 2015; Lemola et al., 2015; Mireku et al., 2019). A recent longitudinal study, in particular, focused on U.S. early adolescents and provided further evidence for the prospective relationship between their in-bed screen use and these sleep problems (Nagata et al., 2024). Other issues stemming from sleep problems, such as depression, emotional dysregulation, obesity, poor academic and cognitive performance, and a higher risk of accidental injury, have also been well-researched in this population (Cappuccio et al., 2008; CDC, 2024; Musshafen et al., 2021).

In addition to sleep issues and their resulting consequences, the physical postures often adopted while using screens in bed, such as side-lying, supine, or prone positions in low light, can cause additional harm to the eyes and increase the burden on the shoulders and neck, adding another layer of health risk (Ahn et al., 2021; Alim-Marvasti et al., 2016).

Why Early Adolescents Are Especially Vulnerable

Early adolescence is a developmental period in which the prefrontal cortex and endocrine systems are rapidly maturing to support emotion regulation, cognition, and physical growth. Research suggests that stable and sufficient sleep is essential for healthy development in these domains (Anastasiades et al., 2022; Mitchell & Nugiel, 2024). Laboratory studies also show that early adolescents are particularly sensitive to evening, blue-enriched light even at low to moderate brightness—conditions that closely resemble typical in-bed screen use at night (Crowley et al., 2015; Nagare et al., 2018; Nagare et al., 2019). These factors make nighttime in-bed screen use especially disruptive for this age group.

Taken together, existing evidence shows that nighttime in-bed screen use is a clearly defined and highly prevalent behavior among U.S. early adolescents. It is strongly associated with later bedtimes, shorter and poorer-quality sleep, and a wide range of downstream health problems. This makes in-bed screen use a critical and appropriate target for health communication and behavior change interventions in this population.



Target Audience

Demographic and Geographic

The primary audience for this campaign is all students enrolled in Hardy Middle School, a public middle school in Washington, D.C. serving grades 6–8 only (early adolescents, aged approximately 11-14) (MY SCHOOL DC, 2025).

According to a relevant source, Hardy has 631 students enrolled for the latest school year, which makes it a mid-sized, manageable whole-school setting for a universal intervention (MY SCHOOL DC, 2025). Meanwhile, students at this school are co-educational and racially diverse, consistent with D.C. Public Schools’ overall profile, so a rigorous stance of equity and respect is essential (District of Columbia Public Schools, 2023; MY SCHOOL DC, 2025).

The school is located in Ward 2 of Washington, D.C., an urban area with a median household income of about $131,400 based on 2019–2023 estimates, well above the U.S. median of around $78,500 (Census Reporter, n.d.).

Plus since national data showing that smartphone access is already the norm in this age group, most students in Hardy are very likely to have personal devices, making bedtime screen use a realistic and highly relevant behavior to address (Common Sense Media, 2022; Pew Research Center & MarketingCharts, 2024).

Parents form an important secondary audience, particularly for components that focus on household rules and the home media environment.



Psychographic and Behavioral Patterns

Early adolescence is a developmental stage marked by rapid social, emotional, and cognitive change (Anastasiades et al., 2022; Mitchell & Nugiel, 2024). 

Firstly, peer relationships, identity, and a sense of social belonging are especially important (Tija Ragelienė, 2016). Fitting in with classmates, being noticed by others, and avoiding embarrassment or exclusion are central concerns, so peers exert a strong influence on young adolescents’ attitudes and everyday behavior.

At the same time, early adolescents place great value on autonomy and fairness (Cooley et al., 2012). They want more say in their own plans and in how they use digital devices, and they pay close attention to whether rules feel fair and respectful to them (Cumsille et al., 2009; Mintel, 2024). This means that campaigns perceived as preachy, punitive, or controlling can easily backfire, whereas approaches that acknowledge their need for choice and respect are more likely to be accepted.

Mintel’s Activities of Teens and Tweens – US – 2024 report (2024) further suggests that this group is strongly driven by self-relevant emotions such as pride, excitement, and personal satisfaction, as well as by experiences that feel cool, fun, and shareable. This suggests that they are more engaged when a behavior-change activity lets them feel energized, better, and able to show something off to others, rather than when it focuses only on risks or prohibition.

In terms of behavioral patterns, U.S. early adolescents are true digital natives (Mintel, 2024). Roughly nine in ten teens report using YouTube, and majorities also use platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram (Pew Research Center, 2024). For them, digital media are not just tools for entertainment but are closely tied to identity and everyday interpersonal and emotional regulation (Granic et al., 2020).



Key Considerations of the Context

Barriers and Broader Issues

Early adolescents’ in-bed screen use is driven by a series of environmental, individual, social, and structural factors. The sleeping environment is the most direct influence. Having devices in the bedroom, bringing phones into bed, and keeping notifications on are consistently associated with greater in-bed screen exposure, nighttime awakenings, repeated checking, and poorer sleep among early adolescents (Gradisar et al., 2013; Nagata et al., 2023). In addition, the digital content environment, with its readily available resources and persuasive features like algorithmic feeds, infinite scrolling, and variable rewards, can overstimulate the mind at bedtime and lead to prolonged, addictive screen use (Accountable Tech & LOG OFF, 2023; Dresp-Langley & Hutt, 2022).

On an individual level, an eagerness for social connection and a fear of missing out (FOMO) create a perceived need to stay connected around bedtime (Scott & Woods, 2018). Additionally, bedtime procrastination often normalizes the use of screens as a way to relax and entertain after a busy day, or as a distraction from difficult emotions during the sleep-onset period (Daniels et al., 2022; Bozkurt et al., 2024). Furthermore, a lack of awareness regarding the negative consequences and a potential third-person effect may lead individuals to believe they have more control over their screen use, thereby neglecting the issue themselves (Common Sense Media, 2022; MacKenzie et al., 2022; Mintel, 2024; Pillion et al., 2022)

At the social level, family and peer dynamics can influence in-bed device use, including the existence and adherence to family technology rules and the screen usage habits of parents, siblings, and friends (Feinberg et al., 2011; Hale et al., 2018; Pillion et al., 2022; Troxel et al., 2015).

Finally, upstream economic and structural factors may include the limited free time and psychological stress from schoolwork and extracurriculars, the discrepancy between parents’ work schedules and available supervision, and a lack of outdoor recreational spaces and facilities (Lang et al., 2024; Logan & Schneider, 2024; Parker, 2014). These factors, in turn, increase the likelihood of in-bed screen exposure among U.S. early adolescents.



Enablers

The same factors also create leverage points for change. For example, since family dynamics matter, setting clear household rules about technology, even if they are not perfectly followed, is linked to better sleep and less nighttime screen use in teens (Bowers & Moyer, 2019). This also suggests that having clear expectations on its own can be a powerful enabler.

School-based interventions are another key opportunity. When behavior-change activities are built into regular classes, teachers can guide the process, and students can watch and learn from each other, turning peer influence into a positive resource.

From a theoretical perspective, well-established behavior-change theories, especially Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), help identify the most effective leverage points. These models have been widely used in health interventions focused on adolescent screen use and sleep. The examples above just reflect core elements of SCT: environmental influences, outcome expectations, peer norms, modeling, and observational learning.

In this campaign, SCT and the TTM are fully integrated into the design of the intervention programs and messages, and I will elaborate below on how they operate within the specific campaign components.



Campaign strategy and message

The campaign begins in schools and uses coordinated activities to involve families. The goal is to extend behavior changes related to in-bed screen use into the students' real homes and daily lives.

Based on the principles of autonomy, openness, and equality, the campaign strictly avoids any experimental manipulation, pressure, exclusion, or stigmatization of students who choose not to participate.

The campaign consists of two stages of activities. Its effectiveness is measured by pre- and post-activity surveys that evaluate changes in students' stages of change regarding in-bed screen use behavior.

Stage 1: Class-based workshop and parents-oriented webinar

Workshop

The workshop will be an opportunity for well-trained educators leading a conversation around screen use in bed among the early adolescents.

The speaker will deliver information across different stages, based on the results of a pre-intervention survey. This approach is supported not only by the TTM, which posits that individuals in different stages of change have different mindsets, motivations, and barriers, making it necessary to craft messages that address their specific problems, but also by relevant empirical research (Noroozi et al., 2024; Prochaska et al., 2015; Velicer et al., 2013). For example, studies by Velicer et al. (2013) and Noroozi at al. (2024) on screen use control among early adolescents customized messages for participants at different stages of change and demonstrated effective outcomes.

However, in this campaign, the TTM will not be used for deliberate segmenting or gatekeeping. In other words, participants will not be staged and then assigned to different or separate sessions, nor will anyone be selected in or out of the program on that basis. Instead, different messages will be prepared and delivered to adolescents within the same shared sessions. Although students at different stages of change are not equally likely to benefit from the intervention, this approach is chosen because the campaign is a whole-school initiative rather than a tightly controlled experiment. It (1) avoids direct labeling, which could be stigmatizing in a visible school setting, (2) is practical to deliver when thousands of students and parents are involved, and (3) more closely reflects real-world public interventions, where it is usually not possible to deliver and enforce highly selective information only to specific subgroups.

Additionally, SCT is thoroughly woven into strategy and message design, not only for this first stage but across the entire campaign. Research from Bickham et al. (2018), Bowers and Moyer (2019), Lubans et al. (2016), and Smith et al. (2014) has proven SCT can offer a relatively comprehensive perspective and various constructs to guide effective school- and family-based interventions that are relevant to early adolescents’ in-bed screen use. In detail, this includes a whole list of SCT’s personal, environmental, and behavioral elements and their reciprocal interplay, such as self-efficacy, self-regulation, self-monitoring, goal setting, outcome expectations, observational learning, peer norms, parenting style, family rules, media susceptibility, and physical activity (Arundell et al., 2020; Bickham et al., 2018; Bowers & Moyer, 2019; Conner & Norman, 2015; Lubans et al., 2016; Xu, 2021).



Sample messages for the workshop

"We all have different screen-in-bed habits. Some feel fine, some feel stuck. Today is just a space to share and see what might help you feel better."

This message is designed for teens in the Precontemplation stage (assuming survey results indicate that such students exist). Precontemplation is the first stage in TTM’s stages of change, where people do not intend to change, and may even resist it, in the near term (typically defined as within the next six months) (Conner & Norman, 2015). The reason behind this indifference or reluctance could be a lack of understanding of the consequences or frustration from repeated failures (Conner & Norman, 2015). This message, therefore, aims to comfort them and lower their defensiveness about reading, talking, or thinking about the behavior. It is positioned as nonjudgmental, open, and respectful of individual differences, and avoids pressuring them to take immediate action.



“Sleep studies with teens your age show that when you stop using screens in bed before sleep, you fall asleep faster, sleep better, and usually feel less moody and more cheerful during the day, plus your brain is more likely to show up in class.”

This message presents research-backed facts that demonstrate the benefits of eliminating screen use in bed before sleep (Mireku et al., 2019; Mitchell & Nugiel, 2024)

It primarily builds outcome expectations within the SCT framework (Conner & Norman, 2015). Outcome expectations have been shown in practical research to be one of the key constructs that can effectively reduce digital use among children aged around 12, a demographic close to the target audience for this campaign (Bickham et al., 2018). 

Furthermore, the message is effective for teens in both the Precontemplation and Contemplation stages of the TTM, since the former requires facts to trigger awareness of the need for change and the latter needs stronger perceived consequences to shift the decisional balance (Prochaska et al., 2015).



“Try to explore one simple, funny way you like, such as make a cozy “phone parking spot” where your devices sleep, or agree with friends to save chats and games for tomorrow morning. After a few nights, see if your sleep, mood, and focus level up.”

This message provides practical tips for behavior change, mainly targeting those in the Preparation stage (Prochaska et al., 2015). It is also developed following the key structure and constructs of SCT, including the effects of environment (the idea of “phone parking spot” that restructures the environment), self-efficacy (encouraging students to explore their own favorable ways of change), social support/norms (agree to support each other with peers), and outcome expectations (an expected improved sleep, mood, and focus) (Conner & Norman, 2015).



Webinar

The webinar will be held in parallel with the workshop, but it is targeted toward parents of teens. It will focus on the theme of how they can improve their kids’ sleep, health, social, and study quality, (and even their own). All parents will receive the invitation for the webinar and the recap material in case they are unable to attend.



Sample messages for the webinar

“Research shows that kids sleep earlier and longer when families have digital use rules and even the presence regardless of compliance of the rule matters. Children’s screen habits often copy parents’, so even one small rule you agree on together, like where phones charge at night, only use audio and no screens in our hands after getting into bed, can make change easier and feel fair. We prepared a template for the family bedtime screen rule and you can collaborate with your kids to build it together.”

This message also draws on SCT in several ways. First, it targets the environmental and social context of behavior. Research on adolescent sleep demonstrates that family rules about technology are linked to children having earlier bedtimes and more total sleep time (Bowers & Moyer, 2019). While full compliance is associated with the best results, the mere presence of a rule also helps (Bowers & Moyer, 2019).

Second, the message highlights that children often copy their parents' screen habits, which aligns with SCT's emphasis on observational learning and modeling. This statement is supported by a study from Arundell et al. (2020), which examined the screen time behaviors of 542 parent-child pairs (children aged 9–14). The researchers found that parents and their children exhibited similar patterns of screen usage, regardless of the purpose, device, or frequency of use.

Third, the message promotes collaborative goal setting and self-regulation by inviting parents and children to co-complete a family bedtime screen rule using a provided template. This action also supports a sense of collective efficacy, all of which are key concepts addressed by SCT.



"I completely understand that many of you struggle with your own digital devices at night…I have, too. That's why I will never simply say 'be a role model' and leave it at that.

In this webinar, I want to walk you through three simple, hand-picked tools that I have personally tried and selected from the most popular ones available. All of them are designed to help you separate the 'useful' features of your phone from the temptation of endless scrolling. They can help you and your child enjoy an effortlessly calm, restful, and sweet night.

•	A Sleep-Tracking Watch or Band: This device records your sleep and uses a gentle alarm. You'll wake up on time and clearly see your sleep patterns improve.

Example: https://join.whoop.com/us/en/?irclickid=T0rw5tQkdxycTn30t-QkHSGoUkpTW43QeQ89UM0&irgwc=1&afsrc=1 

•	A Bluetooth Alarm Clock: This clock plays your alarm and calming music from a phone placed in another room. This way, you get the sound and comfort without the screen in bed.

Example: https://ihome.com/collections/bluetooth-alarm-clock?srsltid=AfmBOoqE2E07JHKqivTyYZzsXv5upydTT1MuqZqJy9KIyKq1ighezMBZ& 

•	A Large, Timed Lock Box: This box has small holes for charging cables. Everyone can put their devices inside at an agreed-upon time.

Example: https://lockabox.com/lockable-storage-box/lockable-phone-box/”

This message builds on the previous one's emphasis on how the environment, parenting, norms, and modeling can influence a child's behavior.

However, by acknowledging shared struggles and by providing concrete, practical methods, it also serves to maintain the parents’ sense of self-efficacy for change, which is a core construct in SCT.

The three specific tools essentially restructure the physical environment. They also incorporate SCT concepts of self-regulation and self-monitoring. Additionally, they address and replace some needs that might be lost by taking away a digital device, thus managing the parents’ (and children's) outcome expectations.



Stage 2: “Sleep Mode” 3-Day Challenge & 21-Day Challenge

If we consider that Stage 1 is more focused on the initial phases of behavior change by triggering attention, awareness, and consideration, then Stage 2 is mainly designed to guide people through the subsequent stages toward early action and habit formation.

This stage itself utilizes a progressive structure, from a 3-day challenge to a 21-day challenge, to reflect the real progression of behavior change as described by the TTM.

•	The initial 3-day challenge provides a low-threshold opportunity, particularly for adolescents in the Contemplation or Preparation stages. It allows them to try three nights of keeping screens out of bed, compare how they feel in the morning, and build initial confidence without committing to a persistent, demanding change.

•	The subsequent 21-day challenge then supports progression from earlier stages into Action and even Maintenance. Notably, the completion criteria (logging all 21 nights and adhering to the rule for at least 15) match TTM’s idea that action requires consistency but that setbacks are expected as a normal part of the behavior change process (Prochaska et al., 2015).

To participate, students can voluntarily sign up for the challenges. After signing up, they will receive special activity materials, record their progress and feelings as required, and finally win a prize upon successful completion of the challenge. The following table details the mechanisms of the two challenges:



	3-Day Challenge	21-Day Challenge

Timing	Held in week 2 of the campaign, on three consecutive nights.	Starts after the 3-day challenge and runs for 21 consecutive nights.

Materials & Content	Each student who signs up receives a set of Sleep Mode 3-Day Challenge Cards. Each morning after a challenge night, they tick or fill in the card with: 

• Did I bring a screen into my bed before falling asleep tonight? 

• What did I do instead? 

• About what time did I try to sleep? 

• This morning I feel…

• One thing that made it easier or harder tonight was…	Students who sign up receive a Sleep Mode 21-Day Sleep Log booklet. The first three pages are a 21-night calendar (one line per night), and each line repeats the same five Rest Mode daily items as the 3-day card. The remaining pages are blank for students who want to keep using the log after the formal 21-day challenge ends.

Participation	Open to all students who want to sign up. Short sharing sessions are held on each challenge day.	Open to all students who want to sign up. Short sharing sessions are held at the end of each 7-day block.

Completion & Incentives	Any student who hands in a fully completed 3-day card receives stickers and a notebook as a reward. Total success every night is not required. The focus is on trying and honestly tracking their own behavior.	A student is considered to have completed the challenge if: 

• Their booklet shows entries for all 21 nights, and

• On at least 15 out of 21 nights, they mark that they did not use screens in bed (or only checked very briefly and then stopped). 

Students who meet this standard receive a large canvas goodie bag with attractive school- or activity-branded items such as a badge, hat, pen, notebook, mascot toy, and some snacks.

Bonus	Not applicable.	Students who complete the 21-day challenge can choose to go one step further and create a small media piece about their experience, such as: 

• a 1–2 minute short video 

• a simple comic strip or storyboard 

• a short narrative

Every student who submits a creative piece, and meets the 21-day completion criteria, is entered into a prize draw for a few larger prizes, including AirPods 4 and Apple Watch 11.



Sample messages for both challenges

“Try the 3-day screen-free-in-bed test drive. Log your nights, then share your best trick to cheer on your friends.”

“Let’s take this mini in-bed screen-free-in-bed challenge! Earn cool stuff just for giving it a try – and the real win? Waking up the next morning feeling like a nap wrapped in a smoothie.”

“Same rule, longer run. Tell your story and enter the big prize draw!”

“You think you're missing out on a late-night chat or a post? Wrong! You're actually missing out on the chance to win the Apple Watch 11! All your friends are tackling the 21-day screen-free-in-bed challenge to get entered into the draw. Don't let them win without you! Join the long run and go for the gold!”

“Check your progress! The 21-day challenge has sharing sessions at the end of each 7-day block. Come celebrate your success, get tips from friends, and stay motivated for that grand prize bag!”

The design of the challenges and messaging is grounded in SCT, specifically targeting key constructs such as self-efficacy, goal setting, self-monitoring, self-regulation, reinforcement, peer norms, and modeling (Bandura, 2002a, 2002b; Conner & Norman, 2015).

First, the 3-day and 21-day challenges provide teens with a clear, time-limited goal, making the target behavior concrete and manageable. Crucially, the initial 3-day challenge is designed as a short, achievable win to boost participants' self-efficacy before they commit to the longer task. The campaign messaging reinforces this low-threshold entry and immediate gain, through expressions such as: “Try the 3-day screen-free-in-bed test drive,” and “Earn cool stuff just for giving it a try – and the real win? Waking up the next morning feeling like a nap wrapped in a smoothie.”

In addition, the challenge cards and log can facilitate self-monitoring and help participants observe the direct connection between their behaviors and immediate outcomes (e.g., sleep quality), which supports the development of self-regulation. The 21-day challenge offers an extended opportunity for sustained action, and the inclusion of blank pages beyond the 21 nights allows participants who find the tool helpful to continue self-monitoring voluntarily. The messaging supports this monitoring by framing the task as a continuous, autonomous process, such as: “Log your nights,” and “Check your progress!”

Furthermore, the campaign is inherently amplified by the social, peer environment in the school setting, where teenagers learn from and influence each other. The recap sharing sessions are designed to maximize peer modeling and norms by allowing participants to share their feelings, progress, and strategies. The messaging leverages this social aspect for motivation and accountability, encouraging interaction and using social comparison to drive engagement: “share your best trick to cheer on your friends,” and “All your friends are tackling the 21-day screen-free-in-bed challenge to get entered into the draw. Don't let them win without you!” Additionally, the creative media products generated by students who finish the 21-day challenge can further serve as authentic peer modeling for future cohorts.

Finally, the incentive structure serves as a direct mechanism for reinforcement, rewarding effort and engagement demonstrated throughout the process to facilitate long-term behavior change. The sample campaign messaging emphasizes those rewards, especially the biggest ones, to capture attention: “Tell your story and enter the big prize draw!” and “...Win the Apple Watch 11.”



Survey

The campaign will also use the TTM to evaluate behavioral change. A brief, anonymous survey will be given before the campaign begins and again at the end. 

Survey Focus: The survey includes questions that classify students’ stage of change related to the target behavior: eliminating in-bed screen use (DiClemente et al., 1991).

Evaluation Metric: The campaign’s effectiveness will be measured by changes in the distribution of stages of change across the whole student group. 

Rationale: This approach is consistent with established sleep and screen-time interventions based on TTM, which use stages of change as a key indicator of progress (e.g., Bistricky et al., 2025; Hui et al., 2015). 

Anonymity: An anonymous survey reduces the chance of socially desirable responses and helps avoid singling out or “labelling” any individual participant.



Communication Channels

For this campaign, communication is organized with school as the core setting, extending into homes, and supported by online channels.

The school serves as the main touchpoint, covering interpersonal, group, and light mass communication. It is where all target students are physically present every day. Whether through class-based workshops, brief campaign announcements, short class-break sharing sessions, or printed posters in common areas, school-based channels ensure very high reach and avoid relying on social media or students’ personal phones to promote a campaign that is, in fact, about reducing in-bed screen use.

The school setting also allows teachers to act as credible facilitators to guide the process, allows external experts to cooperate with relevant staff and organize activities, and gives students opportunities to talk with each other about the campaign and the target behavior, observing and learning from peers’ experiences. This school-based approach has been shown to be effective in multiple adolescent screen-use and sleep-related health and behavior interventions.

Online channels are used mainly to communicate with parents and caregivers and to host the parent webinar. This format is more flexible in time and location, and it helps keep the issue framed as a practical, manageable topic rather than an extreme “crisis,” which reduces the risk of overwhelming parents or children and triggering resistance or guilt.

Finally, within the 21-day challenge, students are invited to create a short product that documents their journey and feelings during the challenge. With permission, these creative works can later be shared through appropriate school or online channels and may also serve as peer-modelling material for future campaigns.








 

Sample Artifacts

This is a poster that can be taped in the campus. It shows a girl sleeping comfortably in bed while her devices are lying on a desk away from the bed.

Along the bottom of the poster, there is a row of tear-off tabs. Each tab has a short, teenager-friendly benefit of getting rid of screen use in bed. Students can tear off a tab or to keep it or give it to a friend.

The content printed on each tab focuses on vivid, concrete, positive outcomes of the target behavior, which supports outcome expectations in SCT.

The tear-off format is designed to spark curiosity and attention. Also in this visible school setting, when seeing peers stop, read, and pull off tabs, more and more students will join organically. It is a great way to build perceived peer norms and trigger communications on the target behavior and the campaign.



This small “device parking lot” sticker is available for all students to take freely. We encourage students to place it in a fixed location at home. The goal is for them to leave their electronic devices there every night instead of taking them to bed.

From a SCT perspective, the sticker works in two ways. First, it changes the home environment by clearly designating a device parking area and makes placing devices there an easier, default option. Second, it supports students' self-regulation by helping them set a clear goal ("no screens in bed"), perform daily self-monitoring (checking if devices are parked), and experience self-reinforcement when they successfully follow the rule.



These are sample card and log for the No Screens in Bed challenges.

As explained above, the structure and questions in these challenges are guided by SCT and by principles of interpersonal communication.

They help students engage in self-monitoring and self-regulation, while also capturing emotions and reflections that are valuable for sharing and discussion. Eventually, students can learn from one another, feel supported, and strengthen their motivation and confidence in their efforts to change.



Summary of how the two core behavior-change theories function in this campaign

The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) provides the overall logic. It links the campaign components into a coherent progression from earlier to later stages of change, guides the message type and tone for students at different stages, and offers a framework for evaluating campaign effects over time.

Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), in contrast, operates at a more comprehensive design level. It explains how the school setting and specific activities are expected to influence behavior and is woven through almost every element of the campaign. Across the workshop, challenges, artifacts, and incentives, the campaign repeatedly draws on core SCT constructs. 

They together make the campaign theoretically sound, strategically structured, and practically grounded in how students actually think, feel, and act around in-bed screen use in their everyday school and home environments.



Resources

The campaign is designed to run primarily within Hardy's existing school structures, but it still requires a clear set of human and material resources.

In terms of personnel, a school-based campaign lead, such as a counselor or health educator, is required to coordinate planning, scheduling, and communication with teachers and administrators. A key resource is an external expert in adolescent sleep and screen-use interventions. This expert will design the student workshop, lead a parent webinar, and train teachers on core messages, using TTM and SCT in activities, and supporting students through the 3-day and 21-day challenges. Additionally, a designer is needed to create all visual materials and custom prizes.

Classroom teachers will host the workshop, distribute materials, lead brief check-ins, and encourage participation. Administrative staff support is also necessary for arranging the schedule, sending school-home communications, distributing prizes, and tabulating the pre- and post-surveys that assess stages of change and in-bed screen use.



The material resources for the campaign include both educational and motivational items. The school will need printed workshop handouts, "Sleep Mode 3-Day Challenge Cards," "Sleep Mode 21-Day Challenge Log" booklets, posters for hallways and classrooms, and "device parking lot" stickers for students to take home. Furthermore, sufficient quantities of incentives must be designed and purchased in advance for all potential participants: small 3-day rewards, more substantial 21-day completion rewards, and a limited number of high-value final prizes.

Logistically, the campaign requires several key approvals from school leadership such as the use of class time, the approach and communication with parents, the running of the survey, and the offering of incentives. A clear operational plan is also necessary for key processes, specifically how materials are stored and distributed. Finally, a protocol must be established for handling consent and privacy, particularly if student creative products or survey data are later used for reporting or future campaigns.

Conclusion

Overall, the “Let’s Go into Sleep Mode” campaign aims to help U.S. early adolescents, specifically those at Hardy Middle School in Washington D.C., eliminate screen use while in bed.

The strategy effectively combines two key theoretical frameworks, the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, with practical elements such as school structures, family engagement, and peer support.

By making the process of change concrete, achievable, progressive, and rewarding, the campaign offers its target students a realistic and supported path toward healthier screen habits, improved sleep, and ultimately a better life.
